### Pseudocode

Pseudocode is writing code in a more high-level and understandable way. Pseudocode is a great way to structure code and brainstorm ways to solve a programming problem. Pseudocode can help you avoid: (a) scrolling through the blocks pane to find what blocks you can use, (b) spending time making a program only to realize it fundamentally doesn't work, (c) overcomplicating a program because you are programming it without planning it out, etc.

**Examples:**

*Write pseudocode for a basic line follower:* forever, if reflected light intensity > 30, turn right, otherwise turn left

*Write pseudocode for a program that turns X degrees:* if degrees < 0, turn left until abs of degrees = X, otherwise turn right until degrees = X

After writing pseudocode, you can just convert the pseudocode into code, whether you're programming in blocks or a typed programming language.

### Practicing Pseudocode

*Fill out the pseudocode practice form on Google Classroom.*

### Project: Basic Line Follower

Now that you know about pseudocode, make a basic line follower utilizing this strategy. Collaborate by adding a class comment to the "Basic Line Follower" assignment. Try to coordinate the project between yourselves but don't hesitate to contact me if you have any issues.

**Also, if you have any questions, feel free to message me privately in Google Classroom. You can do this by going to the Classwork tab, clicking on any assignment, and clicking "Add comment" under "Private comments".**
